# Markdown Previewer

Project 2 of Front End Libraries from freeCodeCamp.

This project is built using React, HTML, CSS & MarkedJS.

### Project Objectives:

1. Given basic HTML and CSS files, use front end library React to create a markdown previewer which will render the input text based on Github flavored markdown.

2. The first load contains the following valid markdowns: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.
